# YouTube to Spotify

A Google Chrome extension to quickly go from a YouTube music video to a Spotify track. Installs a browser action icon in Chrome which, when clicked on in a `youtube.com/watch` url, will parse the current video's title for an artist and track name, then search Spotify for that track and artist, and display the first five results inline.

## Plans

I plan on improving this over time, but I doubt I'll ever truly finish this. These are some of my ideas:
 - Add a button next to each search result to add that track to a Spotify playlist called "From YouTube"
  - Requires authentication
 - Make my own icon so Spotify doesn't sue me

## Install

Since this is pretty featureless right now, I have not uploaded to the Google store, but if you would like to install it, just download the project and install using [these steps](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked).
